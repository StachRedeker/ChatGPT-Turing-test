# ChatGPT Turing Test
> Can you spot the difference between a human and an artificial intelligence? Test your skills using the **unofficial ChatGPT Turing Test**.

## Turing test background
The [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) is a research method presented by mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing. The test aims to evaluate the ability of a computer program to exhibit intelligent behaviour. Most Turing tests work by presenting computer-generated and human-generated responses to a panel of humans. If the panel is unable to correctly identify which responses belong to the computer, the computer fooled the panel and passed the Turing test.

## Experimental setup
Although it is easy to let ChatGPT generate many different answers to a specific question, finding a bank of **human** responses is surprisingly difficult. I did not want to be like ChatGPT and scrape the entire internet, nor did want I to break international copyright laws by transcribing videos, like [100 people tell us a secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRW3Y-rgaOs).

Where could I possibly gain access to human data? I went to Wikipedia. From the discussion page of [Wikipedia's neutral point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view), I collected 5 human snippets from the discussion. I'm obligated to inform you that those 5 snippets are distributed under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licence. I tasked ChatGPT to come up with 5 fictitious sentences that would fit within the page.

Are you able to distinguish between humans and machine? You will be presented with 5 randomly selected statements. Your job is to find out if the statement is written by a human.

## Collecting data
If the number of people participating in my little web project is significant, I might be able to draw some conclusions from the data. I need your help to collect measurements. If you press the 'participate in the study', you agree to the following:
- I will record your answers (yes/no) using the tools of Google Analytics.
- Your answers will be processed anonymously. I do not keep track of who you are, what your IP address is, or what other pages you visited.

If you do not wish to share your data, please press 'do not participate in the study'. You will have the same experience. Also, **for the sake of science**, press 'do not participate in the study' if you have already done the experiment (with or without tracking) and want to play again.

The ChatGPT-generated content is legally dubious in terms of licensing, because it is unclear where the input data are coming from.
